        <p className="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Plans change. Flights get missed. Emergencies happen. Cancelling a
          flight doesn’t have to be painful — but it does require attention to
          details, timing, and paperwork. Below is an open, thorough, and
          original guide you can publish on your site that walks readers through
          cancelling a Sky Airline booking, what to expect, pitfalls to avoid,
          and how to get help (including your contact number).

          Quick primer — what you need before you start
        </h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-1">
          <li>Booking reference (PNR) — normally a short alphanumeric code.</li>
          <li>Full name of the passenger as printed on the PNR.</li>
          <li>Email address used for booking.</li>
          <li>
            Last four digits of the payment card used (or payment receipt).
          </li>
          <li>
            Screenshot or copy of the e-ticket and fare rules (the fine print).
          </li>
          <li>
            Any travel insurance policy number and supporting documents (if
            applicable).

        </ul>
        <p className="mb-6">

        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-700 mt-8 mb-3">
          Step 1 — Pause, read the rules, and set a cancellation goal
        </h2>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 space-y-1">
          <li>
            Open your booking email and read the fare details (Zero, Plus, Full
            — or promotional fare).
          </li>
          <li>
            Decide your goal: immediate cash refund, travel credit/voucher, or
            rebooking to a new date.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you purchased travel insurance or bought a refundable fare, note
            that — it usually changes the best path.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p className="mb-6 italic text-gray-700">
          Why this matters: Cancelling blindly can convert a refundable ticket
          into a non-refundable loss. Take 3–5 minutes to confirm your options.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-700 mt-8 mb-3">
          Step 2 — Try to modify first (often cheaper)
        </h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-1">
          <li>
            Rebooking to a nearby date or changing the passenger is often
            cheaper than cancelling and repurchasing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Check “Change flight” options in your “My Trips” page — some fares
            allow free or low-cost changes.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-6">
          If you still want to cancel entirely, continue to Step 3.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-700 mt-8 mb-3">
          Step 3 — Use Sky Airline’s online self-service (fastest)
        </h2>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 space-y-1">
          <li>Visit www.skyairline.com → Manage My Booking / My Trips.</li>
          <li>Enter your PNR and last name.</li>
          <li>Select the flight and choose Cancel booking.</li>
          <li>
            The site will show available outcomes (refund, voucher, partial
            refund). Choose one and confirm.
          </li>
          <li>
            Screenshot the confirmation page and save the confirmation email.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p className="mb-6">
          If the website doesn’t show cancellation options or errors out, don’t
          panic — go to Step 4.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-700 mt-8 mb-3">
          Step 4 — Call for human help (use your number for support)
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4 font-medium">
          📞 +1 844-607-4888 — have your PNR, name, and payment details ready.

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-1">
          <li>
            Ask the agent to explain your fare rules and the exact refund or
            voucher you’ll receive.
          </li>
          <li>
            Get the agent’s name and a case/reference number for the
            cancellation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Request an email confirmation immediately while you’re on the call.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Phone cancellations are helpful when multiple passengers, refunds,
          insurance claims, or partial refunds are involved.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-700 mt-8 mb-3">
          Step 5 — Track refunds and voucher timelines
        </h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-1">
          <li>
            Refunds to cards typically show in 7–30 business days (depends on
            bank/processor).
          </li>
          <li>
            Vouchers / travel credit can be issued within 24–72 hours and
            usually have an expiry date (often 6–12 months).
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep the cancellation confirmation email and voucher code — these
            are required for rebooking or claiming funds.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-6">
          If refund is delayed beyond the timeframe promised, call{" "}
          <strong>+1 844-607-4888</strong> with your confirmation details.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-700 mt-8 mb-3">
          Step 6 — Use travel insurance or card protection if applicable
        </h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-1">
          <li>
            If cancellation is due to illness, jury duty, or other covered
            reasons, file an insurance claim with your insurer immediately.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some credit cards offer trip cancellation/interruption coverage —
            contact your card issuer with the same documents.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Insurance often recovers non-refundable costs that the airline won’t
          reimburse.

        </h2>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 space-y-1">
          <li>Recheck the email spam folder for confirmations.</li>
          <li>Call +1 844-607-4888 and ask for escalation to a supervisor.</li>
          <li>
            If you paid by card and the refund is not issued, you can file a
            chargeback with your bank.
          </li>
          <li>
            For unresolved disputes, check local consumer protection agencies or
            aviation authorities.

          <li>If travel is uncertain, buy refundable or flexible fares.</li>
          <li>Purchase cancellation insurance if the trip is expensive.</li>
          <li>
            Rebook instead of cancelling when the penalty is similar to the fare
            difference.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use vouchers quickly — airlines sometimes offer discounts for
            rebooking with credit.
