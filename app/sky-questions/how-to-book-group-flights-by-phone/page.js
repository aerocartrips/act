            <li>
              <strong>Step 1: Call Sky Airline Group Desk at +1-844-607-4888</strong><br />
              Start your booking by dialing +1-844-607-4888.
              You’ll be connected to a Sky Airline representative who specializes in group reservations
              (usually for 10 or more passengers).
              Be ready with your group’s basic travel details — destination, dates, and number of
              passengers.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Step 2: Share Your Group Travel Details</strong><br />
              During the call, the representative will ask for:
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                <li>Departure and return destinations</li>
                <li>Number of travelers (minimum 10 to qualify as a group)</li>
                <li>Travel dates and flexibility</li>
                <li>Preferred flight times</li>
                <li>Baggage and seat preferences</li>
              </ul>
              Once you provide these details, the agent will check group fare availability and share
              discounted options.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Step 3: Receive a Customized Group Fare Quote</strong><br />
              Sky Airline offers special group pricing that often includes lower per-person fares, free
              name changes (within limits), and extended payment time.
              The agent will send you a group fare quote via email with all details, including:
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                <li>Fare per passenger</li>
                <li>Booking conditions</li>
                <li>Payment deadlines</li>
              </ul>
              If you’re satisfied, you can confirm your group reservation immediately by calling back at
              +1-844-607-4888.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Step 4: Confirm and Pay for Your Group Booking</strong><br />
              Once you’re ready to book:
              <ol className="list-decimal list-inside ml-4">
                <li>Confirm passenger names (only the group leader’s name may be required initially).</li>
                <li>Pay a small deposit to secure the seats.</li>
                <li>Complete the full payment before the deadline provided by Sky Airline.</li>
              </ol>
              After payment, the airline will issue e-tickets for every group member.
              Need to adjust or add passengers later? Just call +1-844-607-4888 for instant modifications.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Step 5: Get Your Group Booking Confirmation</strong><br />
              Once confirmed, you’ll receive an email from Sky Airline containing:
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                <li>Booking reference number</li>
                <li>Passenger details</li>
                <li>Flight schedule</li>

              You can then share this with all group members for easy check-in.
